# RC Car Project

This repository contains the code and PCB designs for an RC car built using the ATmega328 microcontroller and programmed using the Arduino IDE. The project was a collaborative effort between myself and my friend Hushki.

## Project Overview

The RC car project involved building both the car itself and the RC controller. I was responsible for designing the PCB and writing the code for the car, while Hushki designed the PCB and wrote the code for the RC controller. The car is controlled wirelessly using the RC controller, allowing for remote control of its movement.

## Features

- Remote control of the car using the RC controller
- Forward, backward, left, and right movement controls
- Real-time control and response for smooth driving experience
- Customizable and expandable design for further enhancements
